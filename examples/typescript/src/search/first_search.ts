/**
 * Problem: You need the first results page for a Movies project.
 *
 * Step 2: Build a request, send it, read the hits and the response envelope.
 * Run: npm run example -- first_search [query]
 * Requires SMARTSEARCH_PROJECT_ID with the Movies sample schema; adapt fields to your data.
 * Public Core project search uses the service identity, not delegated Workplace access.
 * Try it: run the request, read the hits, then change only the option this step teaches.
 * Expected: hits=<count>, actual mode and warning, followed by returned document fields.
 * If refused: check project assignment and schema; an empty list is a valid search outcome.
