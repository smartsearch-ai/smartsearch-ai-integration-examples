 * Public Core project search uses the service identity, not delegated Workplace access.
 * Try it: run the request, read the hits, then change only the option this step teaches.
 * Expected: hits=<count>, actual mode and warning, followed by returned document fields.
 * If refused: check project assignment and schema; an empty list is a valid search outcome.
