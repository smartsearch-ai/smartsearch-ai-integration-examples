# Step 20: turn_off_query_expansion
# HTTP: POST /core/projects/{projectId}/search
# Problem: Related-word expansion is too broad for this request; compare the project default with expansion off.
# Run: ./run.sh turn_off_query_expansion [query]
# Needs: assigned SMARTSEARCH_PROJECT_ID; Movies business-field schema.
# Expect: request route/JSON, received hits, actual mode and warning.
# Try: predict the change, run it, then change one option or filter value.
# If refused: verify project assignment and field names; zero hits can be valid.

# Request JSON:
# Complete representative payload; demo resource IDs stand for your task settings.
# Repeated calls below change the demonstrated option or conversation turn.
